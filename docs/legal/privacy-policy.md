# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to us. It is PrograMaker's policy to respect your privacy and comply with any applicable law and regulation regarding any personal information we may collect about you, including across our website, [programaker.com](https://programaker.com), and other sites we own and operate.

This policy is effective as of 24 February 2021 and was last updated on 24 February 2021.

## Third-Party Service Integration

PrograMaker allows you to integrate and issue commands for various online third-party services ("Third-Party Services"). In order to take advantage of this feature, you may need to authenticate, register for or log into Third-Party Services through the Service or on the websites of their respective providers. When you enable linking between or log in to Third-Party Services through PrograMaker, we will collect relevant information necessary to enable the Service to access that Third-Party Service and your data and content contained within that Third-Party Service ("Login Credentials"). We may store your Login Credentials long enough to enable linking to the Third-Party Service.

When you enable PrograMaker to link content and data between Third-Party Services, the Third-Party Services will provide us with access to certain information that you may have provided to the Third-Party Services. We will use and store such information in the way you explicitly enable, in the programs you build, and by the rules you set to govern the linking. In addition, you can use the PrograMaker to share content and Personal Data amongst the Third-Party Services you integrate. Please remember that the manner in which Third-Party Services use, store and disclose your information is governed by the policies of such Third-Party Services, and PrograMaker shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any Third-Party Services that may be enabled.

### Integrations built by other users

PrograMaker also gives the options to the users to build their own links to Third-Party Services. Please be aware that we have no control over links provided by other users of the PrograMaker platform, and while we take steps for the user account that connects to this bridge to remain anonymous, the information used and sent by the bridge may be processed by the user that provides it. For this reason we cannot accept responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of bridges to third parties provided by other users.

### Opt-in logging of link data

PrograMaker offers the opt-in feature to log the information that passes through the user's connection to a Third-Party Service. By enabling this option the information taken that comes from the Third-Party Service by the user might be stored on PrograMaker's servers for later usage by the user. Only the user that opted-in for this will be able to use it. This information **will not** be used or disclosed by PrograMaker unless the law requires it. 

## Information We Collect
