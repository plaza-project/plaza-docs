## ../docs/BRIDGES

This directory contains the documentation about the bridges.

****If you goes to create a specific Bridge documentation, please
create a subdirectory with its name in UPPERCASE inside the
ABOUT_BRIDGE subdirectory.***

### Add a new documentation about a specific bridge

#### Example with a Bridge called "My bridge"
```system
../plaza-docs/docs/BRIDGES/ABOUT_BRIDGE/MY_BRIDGE_BRIDGE
```

To add a new Bridge documentation you will need to create a new directory
in this path:

```system
../plaza-docs/docs/BRIDGES/ABOUT_BRIDGE/
```

The name for the new directory it was needed to be appended with the "_BRIDGE" string.

If you goes to add documentation about your Bridge called "My bridge" the result name is "MY_BRIDGE_BRIDGE" allways in UPPERCASE with the append string "_BRIDGE"
