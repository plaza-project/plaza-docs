## ../docs/bridges

This directory contains the documentation for each bridge.

To create a specific Bridge documentation, create a subdirectory with its name in **lowercase** in this subdirectory.

### Add a new documentation about a specific bridge

#### Example with a Bridge called "My bridge"
```system
../plaza-docs/docs/bridges/my_bridge/README.md
```

To add a new Bridge documentation you will need to create a new directory
in this path:

```system
../plaza-docs/docs/bridges/my_bridge/
```
