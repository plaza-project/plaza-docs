# Plaza project have 3 principal components:

- **Backend** : The internal Plaza core.
- **Frontend** : The web user access to interact with Plaza core data.
- **Bridges** : Something similar to "widgets" who can connect Plaza core with external internet resources.

## The basic diagram is:
üë§ User ‚ÜîÔ∏è üíª **Frontend** ‚ÜîÔ∏è ‚öôÔ∏è **Backend** ‚ÜîÔ∏è üì° **Bridges** ‚ÜîÔ∏è üìú External services
    
### Backend

It's the piece that makes everything work (the core ‚öôÔ∏è).

Runs the programs you build, remembers the important stuff and interconnects the bridges.

The backend consists in a something similar to a  virtual machine, runs "low level code" and relies on bridges to connect with external services,
like Telegram¬©.

[‚¨ÜÔ∏èindex](#index)
### Bridges

**Bridges** are small programs that connect the Plaza backend to any service.

This small programs can be built by anyone ( like a Firefox¬© addons ), they are run from outside the Plaza platform.

This programs are basic and intermediaries between the external services API's ( Like Telegram¬©, your favorite forecast platform, another external product... ) and the **Backend** **Plaza core ‚öôÔ∏è**.

Its principal function is to *"translate"* that *"üì° protocols"* to the internal **Plaza core ‚öôÔ∏è**.

### Frontend

The **frontend** ([https://projectplaza.space](https://projectplaza.space) ) is the project interface you can see through the browser, this makes Plaza cross-platform by default.

It takes information from the Plaza **Backend** and shows it visually.

Then the user can, through the **frontend**, send orders to the backend to modify this information.

It takes programs from the **Plaza Backend** and shows them visually.

Then the user through the **frontend**, can create, modify or delete these programs in the fronted editor.

This makes it possible for anyone to develop new applications.

Press in "Show/hide" section to see the blocks list.

Click and drag the *"hat block"* with the text "When received any message. Set [i]" to the blank zone, it goes to be like your first code line.

Click in the [i] > *Rename variable* > write "start".

**(With this block the program is ready to respond to the telegram "/start" command.)*
